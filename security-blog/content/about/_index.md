# About me
Welcome to my security blog where I post my research and findings on various security topics.
## What I Do

My research primarily centers around:

- **Binary Exploitation**: Finding and exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in native applications
- **OS Internals Research**: Deep dives into operating system mechanisms, kernel structures, and privilege escalation
- **XNU RESEARCH**: Deepdive into modern XNU security on iOS and macOS.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Dissecting complex binaries, malware samples, and proprietary software
- **CTF Competition**: Competing in and creating challenges focused on pwn, reverse engineering, and low-level exploitation

Feel free to look around!
