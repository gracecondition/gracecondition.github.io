# Demo Tutorial - Binary Exploitation Basics

*This is a demo template showing the proper structure for tutorial posts.*

## Introduction

Tutorial introduction should:
- Explain what skill or concept will be taught
- Define prerequisites and required knowledge
- Set expectations for what readers will learn
- Provide motivation for why this matters

## Prerequisites

List what readers should know before starting:
- Programming experience (language level)
- System/architecture knowledge
- Required tools and setup
- Optional but helpful background

## Fundamental Concepts

Explain the core concepts:

### Concept 1: Memory Layout

Describe how systems work at a fundamental level.

```
+------------------+
|      Stack       |  <- High addresses
+------------------+
|        |         |
|        v         |
|                  |
|        ^         |
|        |         |
+------------------+
|      Heap        |
+------------------+
|      Data        |
+------------------+
|      Text        |  <- Low addresses
+------------------+
```

### Concept 2: Technical Details

Provide technical depth:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void example_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[64];
    // Example showing a concept
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    printf("Buffer: %s\n", buffer);
}
```

## Practical Example

Walk through a hands-on example:

### Step 1: Setup

Instructions for setting up the example.

### Step 2: Analysis

How to analyze and understand what's happening.

### Step 3: Exploitation/Solution

Demonstrating the technique:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

# Example exploit code
context.arch = 'amd64'

# Build payload
payload = b'A' * 64
payload += p64(0xdeadbeef)  # Return address

# Send payload
p = process('./example')
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

## Modern Protections

Discuss contemporary security measures:

- **ASLR**: Address Space Layout Randomization
- **DEP/NX**: Data Execution Prevention
- **Stack Canaries**: Stack smashing detection
- **PIE**: Position Independent Executable

## Exercises

Provide practice opportunities:

1. **Exercise 1**: Modify the example to handle different buffer sizes
2. **Exercise 2**: Implement a simple exploit for the given binary
3. **Exercise 3**: Research how to bypass one of the modern protections

## Further Reading

Resources for deeper understanding:
- Academic papers on the topic
- Additional tutorials and courses
- Tools and frameworks
- Community resources
