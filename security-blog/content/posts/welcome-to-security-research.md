## Research Philosophy

My approach to security research is grounded in:

1. **Responsible Disclosure**: All vulnerabilities are reported through proper channels
2. **Educational Focus**: Sharing knowledge to improve overall security posture
3. **Practical Application**: Bridging theory and real-world implementation
4. **Community Contribution**: Supporting the broader security community
