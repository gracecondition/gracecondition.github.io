MACHSEC DOCUMENTATION - TECHNICAL CONTENT ISSUES
================================================

LINE 209-214: PIE address example potentially misleading
- Current: Shows "0x40080" before PIE and "0x00080" after PIE
- Issue: PIE doesn't make addresses become "0x00080". Instead, PIE makes the binary load at a randomized base address. The offset remains consistent, but the base address changes.
- Fix: Clarify that PIE randomizes the BASE ADDRESS, not zeros out high bytes. Example: without PIE: 0x0000000000400080 (fixed base), with PIE: 0x00007f8a4b200080 (randomized base + same offset 0x80).

LINE 325-326: RPATH/RUNPATH description imprecise
- Current: "Rpath and runpath are the paths where libraries reside on them system"
- Issue: RPATH/RUNPATH don't indicate where libraries "reside" but where to search for them.
- Fix: "Rpath and runpath specify search paths where the dynamic linker should look for shared libraries at runtime"

LINE 383-430: RELRO section potentially misleading for Mach-O
- Current: Describes RELRO detection for Mach-O
- Issue: RELRO (RELocation Read-Only) is primarily an ELF/Linux concept. Mach-O binaries don't have RELRO in the same way. The detection code checks segment permissions which is related but not identical.
- Fix: Add clarification that RELRO is an ELF concept and this detection is checking for "RELRO-equivalent" protections on Mach-O (segment permission restrictions). Consider noting that Mach-O has different mechanisms.

LINE 395-405: GOT description context
- Current: Describes GOT in context of Mach-O/macOS
- Issue: GOT (Global Offset Table) is primarily an ELF concept. Mach-O uses different structures like lazy/non-lazy symbol pointer sections (__la_symbol_ptr, __nl_symbol_ptr).
- Fix: Clarify that while similar concepts exist, Mach-O primarily uses symbol pointer sections rather than a GOT. Or explain this is a simplified explanation and Mach-O has equivalent structures.

LINE 1049: Notation issue
- Current: "0x00000002fa89efa8zz"
- Issue: The "zz" suffix is non-standard and unclear
- Fix: Remove the "zz" or replace with actual example bytes, or clarify that "zz" represents "unused/zero bits"

LINE 1059-1061: PAC cryptographic primitive description
- Current: "truncate(hmac(key, ptr || context))"
- Issue: PAC uses QARMA (a tweakable block cipher), not HMAC (hash-based MAC). These are different cryptographic primitives.
- Fix: Change formula to better reflect QARMA usage: "PAC = QARMA_encrypt(key, pointer, context)[top_bits]" or add note that this is simplified and actual algorithm uses QARMA tweakable block cipher.

LINE 1066: HMAC description in context of PAC
- Current: "hmac - hash-based message authentication code"
- Issue: This reinforces the incorrect notion that PAC uses HMAC. PAC actually uses QARMA.
- Fix: Either remove this line or clarify: "Note: This is a simplified representation. PAC actually uses QARMA, a tweakable block cipher, not HMAC."

LINE 1072: PAC scope clarification
- Current: "PAC ONLY SIGNS INSTRUCTION POINTERS AND RETURN ADDRESSES (AND SOME BASIC VARIABLES)"
- Issue: "SOME BASIC VARIABLES" is vague. PAC can sign function pointers and in some implementations data pointers, but the limitation is about C language semantics, not variable types.
- Fix: "PAC primarily signs instruction pointers, return addresses, and function pointers. Data pointers can be signed with PAC in some implementations, but this is limited by C language constraints (pointer arithmetic, pointer-to-integer casts, etc.)"

LINE 1360-1361: ARC framing
- Current: Describes ARC primarily as a security mitigation
- Issue: ARC is primarily a memory management feature designed to prevent memory leaks, not specifically a security mitigation. Its security benefit (making UAFs harder) is a side effect.
- Fix: Add context: "ARC, or Automatic Reference Counting, is a memory management feature in Swift/Objective-C that automatically handles retain/release of objects. While primarily designed to prevent memory leaks, it has security benefits as it makes use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities more difficult to exploit, since objects are automatically deallocated when no longer referenced."

SUMMARY:
========
These are technical content issues that affect the accuracy of the security/exploitation concepts being explained. The grammar and style issues have been fixed separately.
